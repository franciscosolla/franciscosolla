# Hi, I'm Francisco Solla 👋

I'm a Senior Software Engineer with 8+ years of experience building scalable, well-architected web and mobile applications across SaaS, marketplaces and consumer platforms. I specialize in TypeScript, React, Next.js, React Native, Expo, system design and moder frontend tolls. With a strong focus on performance and long-term maintainability.

Recently expanding into backend engineering with Node.js, Express, Prisma, and PostgreSQL. And Web3 development with wagmi, viem, @solana/web3.js and bitcoinjs-lib.

I lead end-to-end features, contribute to large-scale design systems, and optimize performance with a focus on UX and maintainability.

## 🧭 Shifting into Web3

After several years working in traditional product lines, I’m now transitioning my focus to Web3. What started as a personal interest in DeFi and liquidity pools became a deeper motivation: to help build tools that promote transparency, ownership, and new forms of coordination.

Web3 has massive potential but it’s still inaccessible to many. I’m excited to contribute to that next wave of crypto-native products that feel fast, safe, and human.
