# Hi, I'm Francisco Solla 👋

I'm a Senior Frontend Engineer with 7+ years of experience building high-performance web applications across SaaS, B2B marketplaces, and consumer platforms. I care deeply about clean architecture, accessible design, and product experiences that feel thoughtful and trustworthy.

Most of my recent contributions are private, under the Xometry organization. However, I'm exploring the Web3 space.

## 🚀 Featured Project

### [Mycelia](https://mycelia.solla.dev)  
A personal crypto learning project and evolving dApp built with Next.js and ethers.js. Mycelia is where I’m experimenting with wallet connection flows, dApp UX patterns, and Ethereum fundamentals.

> The goal is to learn Web3 hands-on by building and iterating.
