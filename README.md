# Hi, I'm Francisco Solla 👋

I'm a Senior Software Engineer with 8+ years of experience building fast, scalable, and user-centered applications across SaaS, B2B marketplaces, and consumer platforms. I specialize in TypeScript, React, React Native, and Next.js. With a strong focus on performance, accessibility, and long-term maintainability.

### 🛠️ What I’ve Worked On
From launching new delivery verticals at iFood, to scaling subscription programs at Faire, building billing flows at Gorgias, and improving SEO + Core Web Vitals at Xometry, I’ve consistently delivered frontend architecture that supports product goals and team scalability. I believe great software is built on thoughtful design systems, documented decisions, and honest communication.

## 🧭 Shifting into Web3

After several years working in traditional product lines, I’m now transitioning my focus to Web3. What started as a personal interest in DeFi and liquidity pools became a deeper motivation: to help build tools that promote transparency, ownership, and new forms of coordination.

Web3 has massive potential but it’s still inaccessible to many. I’m excited to contribute to that next wave of crypto-native products that feel fast, safe, and human.

A personal Web3 learning project and evolving dApp built with Next.js, wagmi, viem, and other tools. Mycelia is where I’m exploring wallet connection flows, dApp UX patterns, and Ethereum fundamentals.

I'm currently based in Salvador, Brazil. A dual citizen of Brazil and Spain, fluent in English, and comfortable working remotely across time zones and cultures. I thrive in async, ownership-driven environments where builders are trusted to deliver.
